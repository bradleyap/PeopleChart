# PeopleChart

PeopleChart is an applet written to provide geneology or org charts for a Unitraverse information lattice. The applet essentially provides a view of vault data at some location and is meant to be deployed within a browser that is targeting a Unitraverse endpoint.

The files in this repo will need to be brought into the web page through link statments inside an .html page. See the .html provided here to see what it needs to include. 

Not everything is available here. Developers will need to understand the Unitraverse APIs. Content authors will need to have a local installation of one of the Unitraverse web products. The rest of the world are simply visitors will only need a browser and a URL.
